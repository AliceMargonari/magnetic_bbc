  <h1>Do Copper Bracelets Help with Arthritis?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Reviewed by Medical News Today staff</div>

  <p>Some people claim that copper bracelets help ease the aches and pains of arthritis. However, there is no strong evidence that they work. Studies indicate that they have no significant impact on symptoms.</p>

  <p>Proponents of copper bracelets for arthritis say the skin can absorb tiny particles of copper, which then reduce inflammation of the joints.</p>

  <p>There is evidence to support that the copper in foods may reduce inflammation in the body and is an essential nutrient for bone health. However, there is a lack of evidence supporting copper absorption from bracelets.</p>

  <p>This article will examine whether copper bracelets help with arthritis, exploring what benefits they might have and why some people may report pain relief.</p>
