  <h1>Do Copper Bracelets Help with Arthritis?</h1>
  <div class="meta">Reviewed by Medical News Today staff</div>

  <p>The researchers in the 2013 studyTrusted Source concluded that copper bracelets were no more effective than a placebo. A placebo is something that seems like a medical treatment but has no direct impact on a person’s condition or symptoms, such as saline injections or sugar pills.</p>

  <p>Believing that a placebo might help can, in itself, cause an improvement. This is known as the placebo effect. This real physical phenomenon could explain why some people report that copper bracelets help them. Placebos can still be beneficialTrusted Source if they improve symptoms and do not cause harm.</p>

  <p>However, the way chronic illnesses can get worse and better over time could also play a role. Dr. Richmond explained that people may begin wearing the copper and magnetic bracelets “during a flare-up period.”</p>

  <p>As inflammation and symptoms subside naturally over time, a patient may “confuse this with a therapeutic effect” that they believe is coming from the bracelet.</p>

  <p>“Pain varies greatly over time in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and the way we perceive pain can be altered significantly by the power of the mind,” Dr. Richmond adds.</p>
